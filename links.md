## LINKS
Here are some neat links to check out sometimes!

1. [Documentation for Debian](https://www.debian.org/doc/)

   A collection of manuals, FAQs, and other bits of information regarding the Debian operating system. A good point of reference for any inquiries I might encounter along the way.

2. [Basic Vi Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)

   Vi is the stock text editor for UNIX operating systems and the one I'm currently using. This is simply a cheatsheet I can refer to when needed. Might update this once I've tried out other text editors.

3. [regex101](https://regex101.com/)

   An incredibly versatile RegEx debugger with references to boot. Supports multiple flavors and features an extensive library of community-made expressions.

4. [AWK cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/awk)

   Another cheatsheet, this time for the scripting language AWK. It's compact and covers the essentials.
