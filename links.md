2. [The RSA Encryption Algorithm](https://youtu.be/4zahvcJ9glg)

   In this two-part video, high school teacher Eddie Woo explains the mechanisms behind the RSA encryption system. Part 1 showcases the data transmission process with simplified examples, while Part 2 delves into the algorithm used for generating the encryption and decryption keys. The videos are straight to the point and easy to understand despite how quickly it goes by. Mr. Woo's energetic personality also helps to engage the viewer in the subject.

3. [GnuPG Documentation](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/index.html)

   Gnu Privacy Guard or GnuPG is a command line tool used to encrypt data in accordance to the OpenPGP standard. GnuPG's official site provides a documentation section for any inquiries regarding the software. It hosts guides, FAQs, and numerous options for community support.

### Week 03

1. [Linux File Permissions: Commands with Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-VqgvBMV7g)

   This tutorial video by Code99 introduces you to the concept of permissions for files in Linux. They delve into the concept of user types and the three permissions a user or group might have: reading a file, writing on a file, and executing a file. These permissions can be altered using the `chmod` command with guides to represent permissions in either numeric or symbolic value. Another command â€” `chown` â€” is used to change the ownership of files to another user or group.

2. [File Allocation Methods in OS](https://www.scaler.com/topics/file-allocation-methods-in-os/)

   This article by Aniket Marwade provides an overview on 5 different file allocation methods. The explanations are brief but informative, and visual examples are provided to give readers a better understanding of what's going on. The pros and cons of each method are also listed to provide a comparison on the capabilities each method has.

3. [Writing a FUSE Filesystem: a Tutorial](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial/)

   This web document by Joseph J. Pfeiffer, Jr., Ph.D. serves as both an introduction to the FUSE interface and a tutorial on how you can write your own filesystem using FUSE. It's quite the extensive read and an interesting personal recount which gives the reader a general idea on how to implement callbacks, data access, and protections in a FUSE filesystem.

### Week 04

1. [Contiguous and Non-Contiguous Allocation](https://www.javatpoint.com/contiguous-and-non-contiguous-memory-allocation-in-operating-system)

   An article about contiguous and non-contiguous memory allocation in a compare-and-contrast format. After a short overview, the writer delves into the key differences of each method. A table of comparisons are also given, providing details on what aspects each method is better at.

2. [Memory Fragmentation, Your Worst Nightmare](https://www.softwareverify.com/blog/memory-fragmentation-your-worst-nightmare/)

   Stephen Kellett at Software Verify gives an extensive view of memory fragmentation and it's effect on running computer programs. The blog post details common causes of the problem as well as symptoms that can help the reader identify when a program is hindered by fragmentation. Various solutions to mitigate the effects of fragmentation are also provided.

3. [Segmented and Paged Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)

   A quick video rundown on both segmented and paged memory, including it's application and characteristics. Explanations are complemented with simple yet effective visuals to better convey the topic.

### Week 05

1. [Full Introduction to NUMA](https://www.minitool.com/lib/numa.html#software-support-of-numa-5125)

   TechTarget contributor Rahul Awati goes into the Non-uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture, explaining how it works and its use in symmetric multiprocessing systems. The pros and cons of the architecture alongside comparisons between NUMA and UMA architecture are also brought up.

2. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://workat.tech/core-cs/tutorial/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-system-os-q0pioxh7iym5)
